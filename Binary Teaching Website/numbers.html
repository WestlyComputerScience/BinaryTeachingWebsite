                    Binary Numbers
                </h4>
                <p>
                    An easy way to interpret binary numbers would be to break them up into separate bits (shown below). Let's take the binary number 1101 as an example.
                </p>
                <img src = "ImagesBeingUsed/Binary Numbers 1.png">
                <p>
                    What's the pattern with the numbers in the above example in the denominator? 
                    As your binary number gets longer, each number exponentially increases by a factor of 2 from right to left.
                </p>
                <img src = "ImagesBeingUsed/Binary Numbers 2.png">
                <h4>
                    Binary Numbers to Our Numbers
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Now knowing the basic split-up approach, we can just add up the numbers at the bottom from left to right <b>IF</b> they have a 1 on top (1 for the on switch). 
                    Also helpful, you can imagine power switches with the I/O labeled on the switch, and only the machines turned on (the side with the I pressed down) produce an output.
                </p>
                <img src = "ImagesBeingUsed/Binary Numbers 3.png">
                <h4>
                    Our Numbers to Binary Numbers
                </h4>
                <p>
                    To convert numbers readable to us back into binary numbers, we need to use a different method. The method I'm showing you is a simple division method. 
                    If you have a number, say 26, you divide 26 by 2 to get 13. This would leave a remainder of 0, so put 0 in the far right of your sequence of bits. However, if you 
                    divide 13 by 2, you'd get 6 with a remainder of 1, so put 1 to the left of our last bit. Keep doing this process until you're down to 1 or 0.
                </p>
