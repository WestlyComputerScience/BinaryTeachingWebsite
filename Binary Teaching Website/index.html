                <h4>
                    Binary?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Binary is a fundamental concept for the foundation of computers and machine learning in modern times, representing data using only two symbols: 0 and 1.
                    Being the backbone for all modern computing, it's best represented as an on-and-off switch.
                    Each binary digit, or bit, represents a state of 0 or 1 (0 for off, 1 for on), and a combination of these bits can be used to create complex instructions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A basic way to put binary better: it's a simple way to communicate complex information for computers/hardware. An example of this would be the binary number 
                    1010 which is equivalent to the number 10 in our language. Each binary bit/digit can be combined to represent anywhere from binary to letters, and even 
                    binary to image or audio files. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Who Created Binary?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    While Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) is credited for the binary system, it can be up to interpretation from scholars of potential plagiarism 
                    from earlier works of Juan Caramuel de Lobkowitz and Thomas Harriot. It was invented around 1679 and published in 1703. It also used 0's and 1's with some 
                    remarks on usefulness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leibniz focused on the binary system to represent logical concepts and explore the relationship between mathematics and philosophy. Primarily used
                    to express basic truths using only 2 states. There was also an envisionment of binary logic used in mechanical calculating devices with an on/off state.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Why Use Binary?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Understanding binary is important for knowing the basis of how computers store, process, and transmit information. Every complex command from data structures storing
                    your personal data into arrays or nodes to adding 1 + 1 can be broken down into binary code for the computer/hardware to read and compute. It's like your teacher giving
                    you a paper for math homework in class. It's got a list of problems written down in your language in which you interpret and compute solutions in your head to
                    write down on paper. The same goes for computers! Except, instead of computers reading English, their language would be binary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of benefits, binary allows for efficient data processing and storage. You give the computer/hardware a bunch of data in the forms of numbers,
                    letters, images, etc. for it to chop up into things like a byte stream (bigger units for file size being kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and so on).
                    It's crucial for anybody going into fields like programming, data processing, and network communications, and it helps a person understand how computers
                    store, computer, and send information.
