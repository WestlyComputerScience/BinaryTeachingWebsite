                <h4>
                    What Prior Steps Do We Need to Understand Before Writing Our Name in Binary?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Notably, writing your name in binary is more complex than converting numbers to binary. 
                    This is because binary bits combine to represent numbers, so encoding letters requires a different method. 
                    A solution to this was the ASCII table. By following the table, we can accurately represent each letter of your name in binary form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ASCII table stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, and it's a character encoding standard used for computers and other 
                    electronic devices to represent text as numbers. Thus, allowing us to convert letters to numbers to binary bit sequences and allowing us to write with the computer. 
                </p>

                <h4>How to Write Your Name in Binary</h4>
                <p>
                    Now that we know the ASCII chart, it's pretty straightforward to create your name using binary. Below is an example of how someone might create their first name 
                    using the ASCII chart.

                    <p>
                        While Morse Code is related to the concept of binary, it's not directly considered binary code. Instead, it uses a system of dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers. 
                        Interestingly, you can think of Morse Code as an early form of ASCII, where dots and dashes function similarly to 1s and 0s. Pretty cool, right?
