                <p>
                    Hi there! I'm Westly Orr, an undergraduate at Iowa State University majoring in Computer Science. 
                    I made this website because I was inspired to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that people commonly use today.
                    In combination with web page design, I also was inspired to learn binary as it's a big part of the field I'm currently in, and I thought there was 
                    no better way to showcase these skills than to help teach others how to use binary with a website!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of this website was for people to learn and understand the use of binary, and I felt that not enough 
                    Teachers today emphasize the importance of knowing/understanding binary. It's a big part of our world! If you have any questions or concerns about the topics 
                    or the website, please email me! Email: 
                    <!-- Link to my email for people who have concerns/questions. -->
